# Getting Started with AgenticMesh

This guide will help you get started with AgenticMesh, from setting up the repository to implementing the first phase of the project.

## Step 1: Create the GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in to your account.
2. Click on the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository".
3. Name the repository "AgenticMesh".
4. Add a description: "A universal agent memory and synchronization framework".
5. Choose "Public" or "Private" visibility based on your preference.
6. Initialize the repository with a README.
7. Click "Create repository".

## Step 2: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AgenticMesh.git
cd AgenticMesh
```

## Step 3: Set Up the Repository Structure

Create the initial directory structure:

```bash
mkdir -p docs project-management src users/patrickmwatson@lifehackinnovations.com users/patrickmwatson@gmail.com organization/Life_Hack_Innovations
```

## Step 4: Add the Initial Files

1. Copy the documentation files to the `docs` directory.
2. Copy the project management files to the `project-management` directory.
3. Copy the README files to the appropriate directories.
4. Create a `.gitignore` file in the root directory.

## Step 5: Commit and Push the Initial Structure

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial repository structure"
git push origin main
```

## Step 6: Implement Phase 0 (Proof of Concept)

Follow the steps outlined in the simplified implementation plan:

1. **Manual Export**: Manually export custom instructions from ChatGPT.
2. **GitHub Storage**: Store them in the GitHub repository.
3. **Manual Import**: Manually import them back into ChatGPT.

### Exporting Custom Instructions from ChatGPT

1. Log in to ChatGPT.
2. Go to your profile settings.
3. Find your custom instructions.
4. Copy the custom instructions to a markdown file.
5. Save the file as `users/patrickmwatson@lifehackinnovations.com/custom_instructions.md`.

### Storing Custom Instructions in GitHub

1. Add the file to Git:
   ```bash
   git add users/patrickmwatson@lifehackinnovations.com/custom_instructions.md
   ```
2. Commit the changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add custom instructions for patrickmwatson@lifehackinnovations.com"
   ```
3. Push the changes to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

### Importing Custom Instructions to ChatGPT

1. Log in to ChatGPT.
2. Go to your profile settings.
3. Find your custom instructions.
4. Replace the existing custom instructions with the content from the markdown file.
5. Save the changes.

## Step 7: Verify the Proof of Concept

Verify that the custom instructions were successfully round-tripped between ChatGPT and GitHub:

1. Make a change to the custom instructions in the markdown file.
2. Commit and push the changes to GitHub.
3. Import the updated custom instructions to ChatGPT.
4. Verify that the changes are reflected in ChatGPT.

## Step 8: Proceed to Phase 1 (Basic CLI Tool)

Once the proof of concept is verified, proceed to Phase 1 as outlined in the simplified implementation plan:

1. Set up a new Node.js project.
2. Implement the setup command.
3. Implement the export command.
4. Implement the commit command.
5. Implement the import command.
6. Test the commands.

## Next Steps

After completing Phase 1, continue with the subsequent phases as outlined in the simplified implementation plan:

- Phase 2: Single User Sync
- Phase 3: Knowledge Base Files
- Phase 4: Project Structure
- Phase 5: Multiple Users
- Phase 6: Organization Support
- Phase 7: Cursor Integration
- Phase 8: Web Dashboard
