# AgenticMesh

**AgenticMesh** is a universal agent memory and synchronization framework that:
- Mirrors your AI agent structure (ChatGPT, Cursor, Claude, etc.) to a GitHub repo
- Allows for bidirectional syncing of custom instructions, rules, and knowledge base files
- Translates markdown instructions into Cursor-compatible `.mdc` files
- Enables persistent, cross-model memory using a modular architecture

> Think "infrastructure-as-code" for AI agent memory and behavior.

## Overview

AgenticMesh bridges AI platforms (like ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor) with version-controlled repositories (such as GitHub). It enables persistent, cross-model memory and configuration management using a modular architecture.

## Core Principles

1. **Model Agnostic**: Support multiple AI platforms with a unified interface.
2. **Bidirectional Sync**: Changes in either GitHub or AI platforms propagate to the other.
3. **Hierarchical Structure**: Support for user-level, organization-level, and project-level configurations.
4. **Secure Isolation**: Clear separation between personal and organizational resources.
5. **Extensible Design**: Easy to add support for new AI platforms or repository systems.
6. **Platform-Specific Configurations**: Manage platform-specific limitations and configurations.
7. **Resilience**: Gracefully handle failures and recover from errors.
8. **Transparency**: Provide clear visibility into synchronization status and history.

## Project Management

To ensure a structured development process, we have a project management flow similar to Jira. This includes:

- **Task Management**: Track tasks and their status in the [project-management/tasks.md](project-management/tasks.md) document.
- **Progress Tracking**: Regular updates on task progress and completion.

For detailed information, refer to the [project-management](project-management) directory.

## Architecture

For a detailed understanding of the architecture, refer to the [docs/refined_architecture.md](docs/refined_architecture.md) document.

## Implementation Phases

The project is divided into the following implementation phases:

1. **Core Infrastructure**: Basic project structure, authentication, user management, database setup.
2. **GitHub Integration**: GitHub adapter, webhook integration, repository management.
3. **ChatGPT Integration**: ChatGPT adapter, custom instructions sync, file management.
4. **Sync Service**: Change detection, conflict resolution, synchronization logic.
5. **Transformation Service**: Format conversion, schema validation, content optimization.
6. **User Interface**: Web dashboard, CLI tool, API documentation.
7. **Additional Integrations**: Claude adapter, Cursor adapter, GitLab adapter.
8. **Monitoring and Optimization**: Logging, tracing, dashboards, performance optimization.
