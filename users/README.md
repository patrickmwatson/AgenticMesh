## Purpose

The users directory serves as a central location for user-specific configurations and projects. This allows for:

1. **Personal Workspace**: Each user has their own workspace for their configurations and projects.
2. **Isolation**: User data is isolated from other users and organizations.
3. **Portability**: User configurations can be easily moved between different instances of AgenticMesh.

## User-Level Configurations

Each user has their own set of configurations:

1. **Custom Instructions**: User-level custom instructions that apply to all projects.
2. **Projects**: User-specific projects with their own custom instructions and knowledge base files.
3. **Settings**: User-specific settings for AgenticMesh.

## Usage

### Managing User-Level Custom Instructions

To manage user-level custom instructions:

1. Navigate to the user directory in the web dashboard.
2. Click on "Custom Instructions".
3. Edit the custom instructions.
4. Click "Save".

### Managing User-Level Projects

To manage user-level projects:

1. Navigate to the user directory in the web dashboard.
2. Click on "Projects".
3. Select a project or create a new one.
4. Manage the project's custom instructions and knowledge base files.

## Best Practices

1. **Naming Conventions**: Use consistent naming conventions for projects and files.
2. **Documentation**: Include comprehensive documentation for projects.
3. **Organization**: Organize files in a logical structure.
4. **Backup**: Regularly backup user configurations and projects.
