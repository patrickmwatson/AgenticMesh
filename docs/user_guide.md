## Features

### Bidirectional Sync

AgenticMesh allows for bidirectional synchronization between your GitHub repository and AI platforms:

- **GitHub → AI Platforms**: Changes in your GitHub repository are automatically synced to your AI platforms
- **AI Platforms → GitHub**: Changes in your AI platforms are automatically synced to your GitHub repository

#### Example: Syncing Custom Instructions

1. Update your custom instructions in ChatGPT
2. AgenticMesh detects the change and syncs it to your GitHub repository
3. The custom instructions are now available in your GitHub repository as a markdown file

#### Example: Syncing Knowledge Base Files

1. Add a new file to your GitHub repository
2. AgenticMesh detects the change and syncs it to your AI platforms
3. The file is now available in your AI platforms as a knowledge base file

### Format Conversion

AgenticMesh automatically converts between different formats:

- **Markdown → MDC**: Converts markdown files to Cursor .mdc format
- **MDC → Markdown**: Converts Cursor .mdc files to markdown
- **Platform-Specific Optimizations**: Optimizes content for platform-specific limitations

#### Example: Converting Custom Instructions to Cursor Rules

1. Update your custom instructions in ChatGPT
2. AgenticMesh detects the change, syncs it to your GitHub repository, and converts it to Cursor .mdc format
3. The custom instructions are now available in Cursor as rules

### User and Organization Management

AgenticMesh supports user-level and organization-level configurations:

- **User-Level**: Personal configurations that are only accessible to you
- **Organization-Level**: Shared configurations that are accessible to all members of your organization

#### Example: Sharing a Project with Your Organization

1. Create a new project
2. Click on "Share with Organization"
3. Select the organization to share with

3. Click on a specific operation to view details
4. View the changes made during the operation

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Sync Configurations

AgenticMesh allows you to create custom sync configurations:

- **Selective Sync**: Sync only specific files or directories
- **Sync Frequency**: Configure how often synchronization occurs
- **Conflict Resolution**: Define how conflicts should be resolved

#### Example: Creating a Custom Sync Configuration

1. Navigate to the "Sync Configurations" tab
2. Click on "New Configuration"

- **Rate Limiting**: Configure rate limits for API access

#### Example: Generating an API Key

1. Navigate to the "API Keys" tab
2. Click on "New API Key"
3. Configure API key settings
4. Click "Generate Key"
5. Copy and securely store your API key

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Sync Failures

If synchronization fails, check the following:

1. Ensure your accounts are properly connected
2. Check for conflicts in the files being synced
3. Verify that you have the necessary permissions
4. Check the error logs for specific error messages

#### Rate Limiting

If you encounter rate limiting issues:

1. Reduce the sync frequency
2. Implement batching for large operations
3. Optimize your sync configurations to reduce the number of API calls

#### Authentication Issues

If you encounter authentication issues:

1. Reconnect your accounts
2. Check for expired tokens or API keys
3. Verify that you have the necessary permissions
