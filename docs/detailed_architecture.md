# AgenticMesh Detailed Architecture

## Overview

AgenticMesh is a universal agent memory and synchronization framework designed to bridge AI platforms (like ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor) with version-controlled repositories (such as GitHub). It enables persistent, cross-model memory and configuration management using a modular architecture.

## Core Principles

1. **Model Agnostic**: Support multiple AI platforms with a unified interface.
2. **Bidirectional Sync**: Changes in either GitHub or AI platforms propagate to the other.
3. **Hierarchical Structure**: Support for user-level, organization-level, and project-level configurations.
4. **Secure Isolation**: Clear separation between personal and organizational resources.
5. **Extensible Design**: Easy to add support for new AI platforms or repository systems.
6. **Platform-Specific Configurations**: Manage platform-specific limitations and configurations.

## System Architecture

### Modular Design

- **Microservices Architecture**: Each component (e.g., user management, synchronization, conversion) is a separate service.
- **Containerization**: Use Docker to encapsulate each service, allowing for independent deployment and scaling.

### Scalability

- **Cloud Deployment**: Deploy on AWS or Google Cloud to leverage scalable infrastructure.
- **Load Balancers**: Distribute traffic evenly across services to ensure high availability.

### Data Management

- **Firestore Database**: Centralized database for managing configurations, state, and metadata.
- **Symlinks/References**: Avoid unnecessary duplication of data, especially for shared projects.

### Security

- **Role-Based Access Control**: Manage permissions and ensure data isolation.
- **Encryption**: Use encryption for sensitive data both at rest and in transit.

### Performance

- **Asynchronous Processing**: Use message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ) for background tasks.
- **Caching**: Implement caching mechanisms to reduce latency and improve response times.

### Flexibility

- **Plugin-Based Architecture**: Allow for easy addition of new features or integrations.
- **Versioned APIs**: Design APIs that are versioned and backward-compatible.

### Documentation

- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Maintain documentation for each component, including API specifications, deployment guides, and architectural diagrams.
- **Tools**: Use Swagger for API documentation and Confluence for overall project documentation.

## Next Steps

1. **Set Up a Development Environment**: Configure a development environment with the necessary tools and services to start building the components.
2. **Develop a Proof of Concept**: Implement a small-scale version of the architecture to validate the design and identify any potential issues.
